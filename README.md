## General info
This project is meant to provide developers with an easy way to get setup with electron react apps. There are a lot of mixed resources out there for developing electron react apps. There are even npm libaries that create this exact template for you (npm create-electron-react). I found that this is is straight forward and leaves out many of the extras.
